Hi all!

Make the exam as close to the mockup as possible.

Figure out what routes and viwes and templates you need.

When you click on someone's name, it should show all of their complaints.

As last time, populate it with at least 5 complainers and Lots and Lots of complaints!

When you turn in your stuff, make sure it includes your code, exported database file, and a text file with the IP address or subdomain/domain name for the deployed work, along with a link to your github (which will obviously be date-time stamped).

If (once / when) you complete the necessary parts, dress it up for extra points
